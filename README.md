A conversion of an Artillery Sidewinder X1 to a Voron Switchwire.

---

I got my start in 3D printing with my trusty Sidewinder X1. It was a great printer for the price and I made a ton of modifications -- eventually leading me down the voron rabbit hole. Eventually it started having electrical issues and I decided to just do a complete overhaul and kicked off a project to adapt the design to a Voron Switchwire.

Most of the switchwire and hot-end parts are printed as designed for the switchwire. The parts in this git repo replace or supplement the existing switchwire parts.

No build guide exists yet but my [build log](https://www.teamfdm.com/forums/topic/338-artillery-sidewinder-x1-to-switchwire-conversion/#comment-1703) should provide enough details.
